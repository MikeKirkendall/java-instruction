     * Create an application that lets a user guess a number between 1 and 100.
     * 
     * SPECIFICATIONS
     * - If the user’s guess is higher than the random number, the application 
     * should display, “Too high!”
     * - If the user’s guess is lower than the random number, the application 
     * should display, “Too low!”
     * - If the user’s guess is more than 10 higher or 10 lower than the random 
     * number, the application should display, “Way too high!” or “Way too low!”
     * - The message that’s displayed when the user gets the number should vary 
     * depending on the number of guesses. For example:
     * - Number of guesses  Message
     *   =================  =======
     *   <=3                 Great work! You are a mathematical wizard.
     *   >3 and <=7       Not too bad! You've got some potential.
     *   >7              What took you so long? Maybe you should take some lessons.
     * - When the user guesses a number, the application should only accept 
     * numbers from 1 to 100.
     * - When the user responds to the “Try Again?” prompt, the application 
     * should only accept a value of “y” or “n”.
     * - If the user enters invalid data, the application should display an 
     * appropriate error message and prompt the user again until the user enters valid data.
     * - The code that’s used to validate data should be stored in separate methods. For example:
     *      public static double getDoubleWithinRange(Scanner sc, String prompt, 
     *          double min, double max)
     *      public static int getIntWithinRange(Scanner sc, String prompt,
     *          int min, int max)
     * - The code that’s used to run the application should also be stored in separate methods.
     * - Use the random() method of the java.lang.Math class to generate a random number.
